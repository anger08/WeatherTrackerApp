# WeatherTrackerApp
## Steps to compile the App

- Go to the root folder of the application
- Open the .xcodeproj file
- Run the App

## Brief description of the app
- The application uses MVVM and Clean Architecture to ensure modular, decoupled code that adapts to the declarative and reactive paradigm of SwiftUI. These architectures enhance the project's maintainability, scalability, and testability.

- The design is structured into layers: datasource for HTTP requests, repository as an intermediary, and use case for business logic. Dependency injection is implemented using containers and patterns like factory, improving reusability and organization.

- This structure enables more efficient, clean, and collaborative development, leveraging the latest Apple technologies to ensure readable and easily extensible code.
  
- I made use of the following resources to develop the application: MVVM architecture, Alamofire and Combine libraries. Clean code. Singletons. SwiftUI Framework
